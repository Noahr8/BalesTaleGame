# Explanation of submissions

Hello!

Firstly, I do want to apolgize for the confusions surrounding the submissions from me and Will. This final day has been a crunch time and we were able to get the game
in the best version we were able to get it in this time frame at around 11:55 and the exporting to build took more time.

A problem arouse when trying to find a way to upload this project. The dropbox submission did not work as the submission was to large so we
resulted to using Google Drive to share the link. When downloading Will's version, I tried to run it and the Start and Quit buttons would just not work!
We believe this to be due to the computer on which he was working on using a higher resolution than 1920x1080. This may not be the case but
we believed it to be better safe than sorry.

I was unable to work on the project from 6-11 and when I got back, when I merged with the latest changeset, it basically broke most of the game. It took me about
an hour to figure out a fix and by then we were scrambling to get it submitted. I finally got it working at around 1:20am and was able to pull the final changeset.
This version should be comporable to Will's however worked for me in 1920x1080 resolution.

We have been using Unity's built in version control system which is very useful for the projects but problems arise when we are all working on the same levels.
However I believe this to be a create learning lesson for us and plan on applying these lessons for the 3D game. We all have worked very passionately on this
project and are very happy with what we accomplished. Thank you for your consideration and I hope you have fun playing our game!
